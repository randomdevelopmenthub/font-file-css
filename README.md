# What's in the middle school bullying is this?!
This is just a project I'm doing for my own use due to having too little of a choice when using fonts in CSS.

# How do I use this??
There are 2 ways.
> 1. HTML
Put this in your \<head\> tag: ```<link rel="stylesheet" src="https://cdn.githubraw.com/randomdevelopmenthub/font-file-css/master/font-file.css" />```
> 2. CSS
Put this at the top of your CSS file: ```@import url("https://cdn.githubraw.com/randomdevelopmenthub/font-file-css/master/font-file.css")```

# What fonts do I have now??
I will list them off in the future, as there will be many added. They are all linked to their original GitHub owner in the font-file.css file.
