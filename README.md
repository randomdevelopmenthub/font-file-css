# What in the middle school bullying is this?!
This is just a project I'm doing for my own use due to having too little of a choice when using fonts in CSS.

# How do I use this??
There are 2 ways:

### 1. HTML
Put this in your \<head\> tag: 
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" src="https://cdn.githubraw.com/randomdevelopmenthub/font-file-css/master/font-file.css" />
```

### 2. CSS
Put this at the top of your CSS file: 
```css
@import url("https://cdn.githubraw.com/randomdevelopmenthub/font-file-css/master/font-file.css")
```

# What fonts do I have now??
Listing will start here. To get the original github repository, go in the font-file.css file and check for your font in a comment, under it the original repository is linked.
